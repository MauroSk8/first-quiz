1. Broken Access Control (A01:2021): Ensure that secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for the mobile app and web frontend. Define appropriate roles and permissions for software engineers to restrict unauthorized access to critical data and functions.

2. Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021): Pay special attention to key management and cryptography to protect sensitive customer data stored in the database. Use robust encryption algorithms and ensure that critical data is well-protected.

3. Injection (A03:2021): Implement secure coding practices to prevent injection attacks, including SQL injections and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Data validation and sanitization are essential to prevent these threats.

4. Insecure Design (A04:2021): Promote a security-by-design approach from the outset of the development process. Identify specific threat models for the system and ensure that the design is secure.

5. Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021): Review and ensure that Kubernetes and AWS configurations are secure. Avoid misconfigurations and ensure that applications use secure defaults.

6. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (A06:2021): Proactively manage and update libraries and components to avoid known vulnerabilities. Establish a policy for managing secure components.

7. Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021): Strengthen identification and authentication processes and ensure that identification-related failures are effectively addressed.

8. Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021): Ensure that software updates and CI/CD pipelines are carried out securely and verify the integrity of critical data. Updates are performed securely, and data integrity is verified.

9. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A09:2021): Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to security incidents. This enables increased visibility, incident alerts, and forensic analysis.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021): Address protection against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks with appropriate security measures.

These measures would ensure that the solar panel startup's infrastructure is protected against the critical threats identified in the OWASP Top 10 for 2021, securing customer data and overall system functionality. Security would be an integral part of the entire development and operational lifecycle of the system.
